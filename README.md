# Terraform Forseti Install

The Terraform Forseti module can be used to quickly install and configure [Forseti](https://forsetisecurity.org/) in a fresh cloud project.

## Usage
A simple setup is provided in the examples folder; however, the usage of the module within your own main.tf file is as follows:

```hcl
    module "forseti-install-simple" {
      source                       = "github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-forseti"
      gsuite_admin_email           = "superadmin@yourdomain.com"
      project_id                   = "my-forseti-project"
      org_id                       = "2313934234"
      forseti_repo_url             = "https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/forseti-security"
      forseti_version              = "dev"
    }
```

Then perform the following commands on the config folder:

- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure

## Requirements
### Installation Dependencies
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.11.x
- [terraform-provider-google](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google) plugin v1.12.0
- [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/getit/)
- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/segmentio/terraform-docs/releases) (optional) 0.3.0

### Service Account
In order to execute this module you must have a Service Account with the following roles assigned. There is a helpful setup script documented below which can automatically create this account for you.

### IAM Roles
For this module to work, you need the following roles enabled on the Service Account.

On the organization:
- `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin`
- `roles/securityReviewer`

On the project:
- `roles/owner`

### GSuite Admin
To use the IAM exploration functionality of Forseti, you will need a Super Admin on the Google Admin console. This admin's email must be passed in the `gsuite_admin_email` variable.

## Install
### Create the Service Account
You can create the service account manually, or by running the following command:

```bash
./helpers/setup.sh <project_id>
```

This will create a service account called `cloud-foundation-forseti-<random_numbers>`, give it the proper roles, and download it to your current directory. Note, that using this script assumes that you are currently authenticated as a user that can create/authorize service accounts at both the organization and project levels.

### Terraform
Be sure you have the correct Terraform version (0.11.x), you can choose the binary here:
- https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/

Additionally, you will need to export `TF_WARN_OUTPUT_ERRORS=1` to work around a [known issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/17862) with Terraform when running terraform destroy.

### Manual steps
The following steps need to be performed manually/outside of this module.

#### Domain Wide Delegation
Remember to activate the Domain Wide Delegation on the Service Account that Forseti creates for the server operations.

The service account has the form `forseti-server-gcp-<number>@<project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

Please refer to [the Forseti documentation](https://forsetisecurity.org/docs/howto/configure/gsuite-group-collection.html) for step by step directions.

More information about Domain Wide Delegation can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation).

### Cleanup
Remember to cleanup the service account used to install Forseti either manually, or by running the command:

`./scripts/cleanup.sh <project_id> <service_account_id>`

This will deprovision and delete the service account, and then delete the credentials file.
